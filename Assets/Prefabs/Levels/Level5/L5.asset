  levelName: Niptuna
  lore: Most of the natives of Niptuna are amphibious or completely aquatic. 95% of
    the surface is water. The ecosystems are delicate and very vulnerable to changes
    in the climate. Volcanic activity beneath the water is frequent and is the cause
    of the multitude of island chains throughout the planet. Humanoid, sentient elasmobranchs
    are the dominant species. They have formed structured societies and constructed
    intricate architecture by shaping coral reefs with tools made of bone.
