# Space Defense

Travel the galaxy and protect planets from invading Cthulu monsters. Upgrade your ship and blast down the waves.

### How to Play

Use the virtual joystick in the bottom left to move.

Monsters spawn on the right side of the screen and move towards the planet you are defending on the right. If any monster reaches the planet, it's game over.

Tap the screen to fire your weapon aimed at where you touched. Activate another weapon using the buttons in the bottom right.
